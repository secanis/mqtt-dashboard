# Mqtt Dashboard

This Mqtt project should help to visualize the actual traffic and other data on a Mqtt Broker.
Initially was this project thought for Mosquitto as broker and a RaspberryPi as host.

## How to run it

This project is set up to be usable on ARM and AMD x64 architectures with Docker.
To save and visualize some data we need a storage. In this case I choose Redis.
In my setup Redis is running in memory only, because I don't need the statistics in case of a reboot of my Raspberry Pi.

```bash
docker run --name redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis
```

After that start and configure the Mqtt-Dashboard:

```bash
docker run --name mqtt-dashboard -p 3333:3333 secanis/mqtt-dashboard
```

To configure the Mqtt-Dashboard you can set several ENV variables:

| ENV                   | default   | description            |
| --------------------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| REDIS_HOST            | localhost | Redis host             |
| REDIS_PORT            | 6379      | Redis port             |
| MQTT_HOST             | localhost | Mqtt Hostname/Host     |
| MQTT_PORT             | 1883      | Mqtt Port              |
| MQTT_USERNAME         | -         | Mqtt Username          |
| MQTT_PASSWORD         | -         | Mqtt Password          |
| MQTT_PROTOCOL         | mqtt      | Mqtt Protocol          |
| MQTT_PROTOCOL_VERSION | 5         | Mqtt Protocol Version  |

> Protocol can be 'ws' || 'wss' || 'mqtt' || 'mqtts'

Full Example:

```bash
docker run --name mqtt-dashboard -p 3333:3333 -e MQTT_HOST=192.160.0.110 -e MQTT_USERNAME=mqtt -e MQTT_PASSWORD=admin secanis/mqtt-dashboard
```

## Development

This project uses:

-   Backend
    -   NestJS
-   Frontend
    -   Angular
    -   Socket
    -   EChart
    -   MomentJS
-   Redis

```bash
# start a local redis
docker run --name redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis

# to start the NestJS dev server
npm run start api

# to start the Angular dev server
npm run start
```
